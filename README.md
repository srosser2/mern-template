# MERN Template
This repo provides a quick template for a MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js application using Docker, and is setup to use TypeScript. It is a simple todo app, with configuration created from scratch, e.g. using custom webpack config instead of create-react-app.

## Installation
Clone the repo.

In the server directory, create an .env file based on example.env.

Run `docker compose up` from the root folder to build and run the containers for Node.js and MongoDB.

Change directory to client and run `npm install` to install frontend depenedencies.

Run `npm start` to start up frontend.
